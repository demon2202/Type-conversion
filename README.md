# Type Conversion

This repository covers various type conversion operations with detailed explanations and examples for each conversion type.

## Binary to Decimal Conversion

Binary to decimal conversion involves transforming a binary number (base 2) to its equivalent decimal representation (base 10).

### Procedure:
1. Start from the rightmost digit of the binary number.
2. Multiply each digit by \(2^n\), where \(n\) is the position of the digit from the right, starting with \(n = 0\) for the rightmost digit.
3. Sum up the products obtained from step 2.

### Example:
Binary Number: \(1011\)

\[
(1 \times 2^3) + (0 \times 2^2) + (1 \times 2^1) + (1 \times 2^0) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11
\]

So, \(1011_{2}\) is equivalent to \(11_{10}\) in decimal.

## Binary to Octal Conversion

Binary to octal conversion involves converting a binary number to its equivalent octal representation (base 8).

### Procedure:
1. Group the binary number digits into sets of three, starting from the right.
2. If the leftmost group has fewer than three digits, add leading zeroes to make it a complete group.
3. Convert each group of three binary digits to its equivalent octal digit.
4. Concatenate the octal digits obtained from step 3.

### Example:
Binary Number: \(101101_2\)

Grouping: \(1\,|\,011\,|\,101\)

Conversion: \(1\,|\,3\,|\,5\)

So, \(101101_2\) is equivalent to \(135_8\) in octal.

## Binary to Hexadecimal Conversion

Binary to hexadecimal conversion involves converting a binary number to its equivalent hexadecimal representation (base 16).

### Procedure:
1. Group the binary number digits into sets of four, starting from the right.
2. If the leftmost group has fewer than four digits, add leading zeroes to make it a complete group.
3. Convert each group of four binary digits to its equivalent hexadecimal digit.
4. Concatenate the hexadecimal digits obtained from step 3.

### Example:
Binary Number: \(1101101_2\)

Grouping: \(1\,|\,1011\,|\,01\)

Conversion: \(1\,|\,B\,|\,5\)

So, \(1101101_2\) is equivalent to \(1B5_{16}\) in hexadecimal.

## Decimal to Binary Conversion

Decimal to binary conversion involves transforming a decimal number to its binary representation.

### Procedure:
1. Divide the decimal number by 2 repeatedly, keeping track of the remainders.
2. Write down the remainders in reverse order.

### Example:
Decimal Number: \(15_{10}\)

\[
\begin{align*}
15 \div 2 &= 7\, \text{(remainder 1)} \\
7 \div 2 &= 3\, \text{(remainder 1)} \\
3 \div 2 &= 1\, \text{(remainder 1)} \\
1 \div 2 &= 0\, \text{(remainder 1)} \\
\end{align*}
\]

The remainders in reverse order are \(1111\), so \(15_{10}\) is equivalent to \(1111_{2}\) in binary.

## Decimal to Octal Conversion

Decimal to octal conversion involves converting a decimal number to its equivalent octal representation.

### Procedure:
1. Divide the decimal number by 8 repeatedly, keeping track of the remainders.
2. Write down the remainders in reverse order.

### Example:
Decimal Number: \(15_{10}\)

\[
\begin{align*}
15 \div 8 &= 1\, \text{(remainder 7)} \\
1 \div 8 &= 0\, \text{(remainder 1)} \\
\end{align*}
\]

The remainders in reverse order are \(17\), so \(15_{10}\) is equivalent to \(17_{8}\) in octal.

## Decimal to Hexadecimal Conversion

Decimal to hexadecimal conversion involves converting a decimal number to its equivalent hexadecimal representation.

### Procedure:
1. Divide the decimal number by 16 repeatedly, keeping track of the remainders.
2. Write down the remainders in reverse order, using letters A-F for remainders 10-15.

### Example:
Decimal Number: \(15_{10}\)

\[
\begin{align*}
15 \div 16 &= 0\, \text{(remainder 15, F in hexadecimal)} \\
\end{align*}
\]

The remainder is \(F\), so \(15_{10}\) is equivalent to \(F_{16}\) in hexadecimal.

## Octal to Binary Conversion

Octal to binary conversion involves transforming an octal number to its equivalent binary representation.

### Procedure:
1. Convert each octal digit to its 3-bit binary representation.

### Example:
Octal Number: \(17_{8}\)

Conversion: \(001\,|\,111\)

So, \(17_{8}\) is equivalent to \(1111_{2}\) in binary.

## Octal to Hexadecimal Conversion

Octal to hexadecimal conversion involves converting an octal number to its equivalent hexadecimal representation.

### Procedure:
1. Convert the octal number to its equivalent binary representation.
2. Group the binary digits into sets of four, starting from the left.
3. If the leftmost group has fewer than four digits, add leading zeroes to make it a complete group.
4. Convert each group of four binary digits to its equivalent hexadecimal digit.
5. Concatenate the hexadecimal digits obtained from step 4.

### Example:
Octal Number: \(17_{8}\)

Binary Equivalent: \(1111_{2}\)

Grouping: \(0001\,|\,1111\)

Conversion: \(1\,|\,F\)

So, \(17_{8}\) is equivalent to \(1F_{16}\) in hexadecimal.

## Octal to Decimal Conversion

Octal to decimal conversion involves converting an octal number to its equivalent decimal representation.

### Procedure:
1. Multiply each octal digit by \(8^n\), where \(n\) is the position of the digit from the right, starting with \(n = 0\) for the rightmost digit.
2. Sum up the products obtained from step 1.

### Example:
Octal Number: \(17_{8}\)

\[
(1 \times 8^1) + (7 \times 8^0) = 8 + 7 = 15
\]

So, \(17_{8}\) is equivalent to \(15_{10}\) in decimal.

## Hexadecimal to Binary Conversion

Hexadecimal to binary conversion involves transforming a hexadecimal number to its equivalent binary representation.

### Procedure:
1. Convert each hexadecimal digit to its 4-bit binary representation.

### Example:
Hexadecimal Number: \(1B5_{16}\)

Conversion: \(0001\,|\,1011\,|\,0101\)

So, \(1B5_{16}\)

 is equivalent to \(1101101_{2}\) in binary.

## Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversion

Hexadecimal to decimal conversion involves converting a hexadecimal number to its equivalent decimal representation.

### Procedure:
1. Multiply each hexadecimal digit by \(16^n\), where \(n\) is the position of the digit from the right, starting with \(n = 0\) for the rightmost digit.
2. Sum up the products obtained from step 1.

### Example:
Hexadecimal Number: \(1B5_{16}\)

\[
(1 \times 16^2) + (B \times 16^1) + (5 \times 16^0) = 4357
\]

So, \(1B5_{16}\) is equivalent to \(4357_{10}\) in decimal.

## Hexadecimal to Octal Conversion

Hexadecimal to octal conversion involves converting a hexadecimal number to its equivalent octal representation.

### Procedure:
1. Convert the hexadecimal number to its equivalent binary representation.
2. Group the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the left.
3. If the leftmost group has fewer than three digits, add leading zeroes to make it a complete group.
4. Convert each group of three binary digits to its equivalent octal digit.
5. Concatenate the octal digits obtained from step 4.

### Example:
Hexadecimal Number: \(1B5_{16}\)

Binary Equivalent: \(1101101_{2}\)

Grouping: \(001\,|\,101\,|\,101\)

Conversion: \(1\,|\,5\,|\,5\)

So, \(1B5_{16}\) is equivalent to \(155_{8}\) in octal.
